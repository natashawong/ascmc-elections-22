I have the requisite leadership skills and work-ethic to take social life – its successes and failures – and institute concrete change. Celebration and support must return after the incredibly taxing two years we’ve experienced as young adults. As Community Service Interim Chair for ASCMC during my freshman fall term, my goal was to tackle local and national needs by engaging the CMC student body. From experiential service trips with local NPOs to social fundraising events, my time serving ASCMC and the greater Pomona Valley community has made a mark. I would be grateful to continue this impact in an Executive Board position as your DAC. Highly involved in multiple facets of the CMC community, I have made impactful social connections with students of many interest groups. My desire to be your DAC stems from the conversations I’ve had with these diverse groups of students: there is a lack of community across quads/dorms and there needs to be more administrative support to our CMCers, especially after the world-altering effects of the pandemic. Free bonding adventures with intersecting quads, mandatory supply of menstrual products, dorm service trips, mental health support and general SHS improvement, and regular cultural celebrations are all ideas I plan to make a reality, ideas I’ve gathered from you: my peers. In an effort to remain accessible and open to change, I will host weekly office hours and work on-call with DOS/RAs to address pressing campus-life problems. Fixing road bumps along the way, as DAC I’ll ensure that you’ll recall the 2022-2023 CMC term 40 years from now as truly “the good life”.'],
