Community is at the heart of CMC—through robust policy changes and extensive events programming, I pledge to make CMC a place that uplifts every student in our community.', 'Institutional Transparency: As the student body representative, I vow to hold CMC administrators responsible for timely and effective communication. It is critical that administrators provide policy updates and guidelines on social gatherings, anti-racism efforts, and campus safety so that students are aware of the changes that impact them.', 'Student Advocacy: Proactive engagement with campus organizations. Steadfast commitments to marginalized students. Consistent empowerment of the wider student body. CMCers have the power to enact meaningful change—ASCMC must address student concerns through dialogue and action, supporting the student body as active advocates in the affairs that affect them. Following long periods of disconnection, ASCMC is at a unique spot where it can redefine our culture to meaningfully involve everyone. Let’s connect, and build this community—together.'
