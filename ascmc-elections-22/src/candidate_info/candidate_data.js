      candidateDescription: ['Hello, CMC! I am Jon Joey “JJ” Telebrico (he/they), a low-income student, affinity group leader, and committed ally. I hope to bring a fresh perspective to ASCMC as your next President! I have worked tirelessly to improve CMC through ASCMC. This past year, I have served as ASCMC’s Vice President of Campus Organizations, redistributing thousands of dollars to student organizations— including affinity groups—and promoting CMC’s vibrant extracurricular life.', 'You can read about my past contributions, present work, and future vision (including 17 pages of policy solutions!) at linktr.ee/jj4ascmcpres or on Instagram @jj4ascmcpres', 'Below is my three-pronged platform:', 'Communal Support: Funding for affinity organizations. International student resources. CMS athlete tailgates. Culturally-adapted mental health support. Free menstrual products and washing/drying. First-year room retention. Platforms for marginalized students. When we show up for one another, we can create an experience that is accessible, inclusive, and welcoming for all. Community is at the heart of CMC—through robust policy changes and extensive events programming, I pledge to make CMC a place that uplifts every student in our community.', 'Institutional Transparency: As the student body representative, I vow to hold CMC administrators responsible for timely and effective communication. It is critical that administrators provide policy updates and guidelines on social gatherings, anti-racism efforts, and campus safety so that students are aware of the changes that impact them.', 'Student Advocacy: Proactive engagement with campus organizations. Steadfast commitments to marginalized students. Consistent empowerment of the wider student body. CMCers have the power to enact meaningful change—ASCMC must address student concerns through dialogue and action, supporting the student body as active advocates in the affairs that affect them. Following long periods of disconnection, ASCMC is at a unique spot where it can redefine our culture to meaningfully involve everyone. Let’s connect, and build this community—together.'

I am ASCMC’s current Academic Affairs Chair, and I also help the Events team plan parties like Monte Carlo, Wedding Party, and Mistletoe Rock.', 'It’s crazy to think that we will be Seniors next year. It seems like yesterday that we were moving out in March 2020. Little did we know then that it would be 18 months before we were reunited on campus. As your Senior Class President, I plan on making up for that lost time.', 'In the interim, we have seen our class grow with new transfer students and students who took LOAs. That 18 months was even longer for folks who studied abroad this past fall, and there are over 40 students studying abroad right now. All of this means we need a Senior Class President who will bring this class together by making every member feel supported. That is why Support is the first part of my SENIOR (Support, Events, New Ideas, Inclusion, Opportunity, Resources) initiative. I want to celebrate all of us as we go into senior year, whether that is through mental health programming, awesome parties, pre-games, study breaks, and takeovers. No matter what, we all have something worth celebrating, and I hope to celebrate all of you next year.', 'If elected, I hope to not only bring my ideas to the table but yours too. I will work diligently to select a diverse cabinet, build upon existing senior traditions and create new ones, plan the best parties, and make sure that every one of us feels supported.', 'While you’re here, please check out my campaign Insta @SamBfor2023 for more information on my platform, initiatives, and ideas.', 'Vote Sam B for 2023!'],

I believe my plans for our Senior Year speak louder than I do in most instances (that’s pretty damn loud). Since our first year, our class has gone through a lot of change - from a year and a half of online school to some of us moving to AK to new students joining us from other classes and other schools.', 'Our class deserves an incredible Senior Year where we continue to bond as a class and celebrate how far we’ve come since our first year. As Senior Class President, I know I will get the job done. Here are some of the ideas I’d like to implement on campus:', '1) Casual and consistent events like painting workshops, Wine Wednesdays, and cocktail/mocktail classes twice a month will help us stay in touch and destress from our weeks, in addition to better-than-ever hallmark events like 200/100 Days, Thesis Parties, and Las Vegas.', '2) Post-grad resources catered to your needs. By collaborating with the Soll Center, we will set up workshops for resumes and cover letters specifically for full-time opportunities, as well as grad school applications so that we’re prepared to leave the Claremont nest.', '3) An Alumni Liaison on Class Cabinet will help facilitate low-stakes conversations with alumni to make connections and hear more about their career paths.', '4) Events that support our senior athletes: tailgates with fun games and activities, promotion of Senior Nights and key games to show our CMS spirit through an Athletics Liaison, and interactive half-time action so that there’s never a dull moment.', 'Above all, as Senior Class President, I want to hear your thoughts and do what I can to make the most out of our Senior Year. I promise to be accessible, receptive, and creative with our time and money.', 'CMC 2023: We’ve come so far. Let’s make our last one our best one.'],

I feel privileged to have met all of you and to feel at home with various communities at CMC', 'If elected, I will bring forth my own experiences and new ideas, and bring together a diverse group of members of our class for our senior class cabinet. I also look forward to supporting my goals in these ways:', 'Memorable Activities:', '1) Continuing and improving senior year classics including 200 and 100 days and senior thesis party. 2) Organizing senior class pregames with drinks, food, and music. 3) Creating varying events to include your interests or interests you never knew you had!', 'Diversity and Inclusion:', '1) Including cabinet members with different perspectives and varying tastes. 2) Integrating all members of our class, including those who took gap semester(s) and those who are currently abroad. 3) Finding a passionate and dedicated commencement speaker - Creating various alumni panels for multiple career paths', 'Mental Health:', '1) Recognizing that while senior year is a lot of fun, thesis and job-search can also be stressful. 2) Continuing with morning snacks like coffee, pie, acai smoothies etc. 3) Collaborating with CPB and other groups on campus. 4) Sharing mental health resources in every email, and working with the elected president to make resources more available. 5) Listening to YOUR needs', 'For more information, please check out my Instagram @amari.2023', 
      'Through my experience over the past year, I have worked with the current senior class president and VPSA, and I know the ropes of event planning well. I have planned several class snack events (Pepo Melo, Luckys Coffee, I Like Pie), and two class pregames (Monte Carlo and Wedding Party). Additionally, For the first large-scale ASCMC event since we returned from COVID, I stepped up with planning one of my favorite CMC traditions. With the help of the VPSA and ASCMC Events Team, we pulled off a phenomenal event with cake pops + champagne, different music, and a photo booth ~ vibes were immaculate. I loved planning these events, and if you vote for me, I will do it again (except even better this time)!'],
